# Sends the signed app or disk image to Apple's notary service, staples the
# ticket to it and checks that Gatekeeper accepts it. The app must be signed
# with a Developer ID and the hardened runtime (make ... CODESIGN_IDENTITY=...).
#
# The release notarizes twice: the app first (its ticket stapled into
# go-link.app, so the copy in /Applications opens without asking Apple's
# servers, offline too), then the disk image made with that app.
#
# One time, before the first release:
#   1. Apple Developer Program membership.
#   2. The "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" certificate in the
#      login keychain.
#   3. An app-specific password stored for notarytool:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials "go-link-notary" \
#          --apple-id you@example.com --team-id TEAMID --password <app-specific-password>
#
# Usage: NOTARY_PROFILE=go-link-notary build/macos/notarize.sh go-link.app
#        NOTARY_PROFILE=go-link-notary build/macos/notarize.sh go-link.dmg
