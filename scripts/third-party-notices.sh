# Third-party notices

go-link's own code is under the MIT license (see `LICENSE`). Its binaries
and website also include the third-party components below, each under its
own license, reproduced here as those licenses require.

The emulator core (mame2003-plus) is **not** included: the device downloads
it from the libretro buildbot on the host's request, under its own license
(MAME non-commercial license). ROMs are never included or downloaded.
