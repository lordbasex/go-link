//   play   play.go-link.org: rooms, invitations and My device (the link to
//          the device lives in this origin's storage). The device's local
//          web panel is this build too.
//   all    every page on one origin: development (npm run dev) and tests.
//
// A page of the other build is reached at its own address: links to it go
// through a route that sends the browser there (OtherSite in App.tsx).
