// The AI pack (docs/willy-maker/file-format.md): everything an AI, or a
// person, needs to produce the ROM with the tools in rom/. The levels as
// Tiled maps with their pictures, each character as animation strips and a
// sheet.json, the project file, the review, our ROM docs and a generated
// PROMPT.md. Pictures are converted to the board's colors. The output is
// deterministic: the same project gives the same bytes (fixed timestamps,
// sorted entries, a PNG writer without a canvas).
