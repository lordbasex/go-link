# Willy Maker: file format

The project file, the `.zip` that carries it between browsers, and the AI pack. Overview: [README.md](README.md). Architecture: [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## The project file (`project.json`)

Versioned JSON; the current `format` is 3. Unknown fields are kept on import (a newer version's data is not lost), and an older `format` is migrated on load.

| Format | What changed | Migration from the one before |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the first format | — |
| 2 | `settings.actionLabels`, `runTapMs`, `playerSlots`, `credits`; every menu screen's `texts`, `background`, `music`, `credits` | the new fields get their defaults (labels empty, 250 ms, Willy and three recruits, `(C) 2026 go-link`, each screen's default background and music); blocks and unknown fields are kept |
| 3 | `genre`: the game's genre, one of the ids of [genres.md](genres.md) (`platform-shooter`, `platformer`, `beat-em-up`, `light-gun`, `horizontal-shooter`, `vertical-shooter`, `top-down-shooter`, `maze`, `versus-fighting`, `puzzle`, `quiz-party`, `sports`, `racing`) | older projects become `platform-shooter`, the only genre with an engine; an unknown genre is read as `platform-shooter` too |

```

Notes:

- **Rules** (`settings.rules`, optional, no format change): `enemyHp`, `enemyScore`, `rescueScore`, `crateScore`, `touchHurts`, `enemiesChase`, `enemiesShoot`, `exitNeedsEnemies`, `respawnOnHurt`, `hurtFrames`, `crateClimb` (`"jump"`, the default, or `"push"`), `extraPorts` (`"soon"`, the default, or `"ignore"`). A missing field is the default value (`engine/rules.ts` `DEFAULT_RULES`); out-of-range numbers are brought into range on read (`rulesWith`). Play mode and Create ROM read the same values ([engine.md](engine.md#rules-the-game-tab)). An enemy object's own `hp` wins over `enemyHp`; an exit object may have `w` and `h` (32 px and the level's height by default). A crate object may have `breakable: false` (shots stop on it; it still breaks when nothing holds it up).
- **Menu screens**: the text fields of each screen are `title` (title, subtitle, prompt), `attract` (caption, prompt), `select` (heading, prompt), `hud` (join, ammo, rescued, cleared), `continue` (heading, prompt), `gameOver` (heading, line) and `highScores` (heading, footer). Text is drawn with the board's 8 × 8 font, folded to uppercase, on the 48 × 28 character text layer; music ids are `none`, `title`, `select`, `stage`, `boss`, `continue`, `game-over` and `high-scores` (references only until Phase 2).
- **Tile layers** store tile indices per cell (`0` = empty), run-length encoded as a string, in row order. **Tag layers** store the tag number per cell: 0 air, 1 solid, 2 oneway, 3 ladder, 4 crate, 5 breakable, 6 hazard, 7 water. Per-cell properties live in `props`, keyed `"col,row"`.
- **Colors** are `#RRGGBB` with every channel a multiple of 17 (the CPS-1's 12-bit colors). A palette has at most 15 colors; transparency is implicit.
- **Characters**: `sheet` is the picture the game uses, at 1:1 on the board (the importer packs the frames into it, colors already fitted to the zone palettes), and `frames` are rectangles in it, so play mode, the AI pack and the ROM read it as it is. Each frame's `zones` lists its palettes top to bottom, one per 16 px row counted from the feet (a shorter frame lists only its lower rows). `source`, when present, holds the dropped sheet and the boxes drawn on it (sheet pixels, same frame ids), so the Characters screen can open the character again; a box's `edit` is a PNG of the frame drawn by hand in the pixel editor, at its size on the board, which takes the place of the box's shrunk picture (it is not shrunk again when the height changes), and a `drawn` frame has no box on the sheet at all; a character drawn from scratch has `source.sheet` null; a character without it (from a template or a hand-made project) still plays. Create ROM cuts a hero's frames the same way, from the feet up, one zone palette per 16 px tile row ([engine.md](engine.md#the-players-looks)); a player slot's `variant` applies to Willy only.
- **Tilesets** may carry `columns` (tiles across in the picture) and `count` (tiles in it); the board meters count graphics from them. `palettes` lists the tileset's palettes (each at most 15 colors) and `tilePalettes`, when present, each tile's palette as an index into it (tile n at `[n - 1]`; missing or shorter means palette 0), so a picture can spread its colors over up to 32 palettes chosen per tile, as the CPS-1's games do; Create ROM loads them into the layer's palette bank ([engine.md](engine.md#layer-palettes)). Layers may carry `opacity` (0-1), used by the editor only. The starter tilesets are `ts-city` (16 px, the play layer) and `ts-sky` (32 px, the far layer), built from the ROM prototype's art.
- **Zones and groups** (optional; the new editor writes them, [editor.md](editor.md); the format stays 3: the classic editor keeps them untouched): a level may carry `zones`, rectangles on the 16 px collision grid that say what a part of the level is (`{ "id", "kind", "name"?, "n", "x", "y", "w", "h", "group", "hidden"?, "locked"?, "hp"? }`), and `groups`, the layers panel's groups (`{ "id", "name"?, "n"?, "base"?, "visible", "locked", "open" }`). Each `kind` is one collision tag: `floor` solid, `platform` oneway, `ladder`, `crate`, `breakable` (with its `hp`), `hazard`, `water`. The collision layer is drawn from the visible zones (neither the zone nor its group hidden), later zones over earlier ones (`model/zones.ts` `applyZones`), so play mode and the ROM read the same cells as before. A level without zones, or whose collision layer was painted in the classic editor, gets them again from its collision cells, joined into rectangles (`reconcileZones`, `zonesFromTags`; the Buenos Aires template's zones draw back exactly its cells). Crate objects add their own cells where nothing else is, as play mode and the ROM do, and are not zones. Names the user typed are kept in `name`; without one the editor shows the kind's name and `n` in the user's language ("Floor 2"), and a group without one shows its base group's name or "Group n". The two base groups (`base`: `objects` and `zones`) always exist; an object may carry `group` (else it is in the objects' base group), `hidden`, `locked` and `label` (the name the user typed; `name` stays its reference). Objects that are hidden, or in a hidden group, are not in the game: play mode (`engine/level.ts` `inGame`) and Create ROM leave them out. On load, unknown kinds are dropped, rectangles are snapped to the grid and kept inside the level, ids are made unique and a missing group becomes the base one.
- **Timer**: a level may carry `timer`, its time limit in seconds (missing or `0` = none). Play mode has no timer yet; the review compares it with the walk to the exit (`level.timer`) and the ROM keeps it.
- **Limits on load**: a file with more than 64 levels, or a level wider than 65536 px or taller than 8192 px, is refused; layers, objects, frames, animations, palettes and tilesets with missing or wrong fields are repaired with defaults (or dropped when they are not one at all), so a damaged file never breaks the editor.
- **Pictures** are referenced by `sha256:<hex>`. In the browser they live in IndexedDB under that hash; in a `.zip` they live in `assets/`.
- Object `type` and properties are the ones in [art-spec.md](../rom/art-spec.md#4-telling-the-build-what-every-object-is). Every object has a unique `name`.

## The project `.zip`

```
my-game.willy.zip
  project.json
  assets/
    9c1e…png            every picture, named by its SHA-256
  thumbnails/
    level-1.png         a small picture of each level, for the project list
  README.txt            what this file is and that Willy Maker opens it
```

Import checks `format`, every hash and every size before replacing anything. A project with the same `id` asks: replace it, or keep both (the import gets a new `id`).

## The AI pack

A second export for producing the ROM with an AI (or a person) and the tools in `rom/` (`io/aiPack.ts`). It is made only when the Export review has no errors.

```
my-game.ai-pack.zip
  PROMPT.md               the generated brief (below), always the first entry
  project.json            the same project file
  review.json             the Export review: ready, errors, warnings, every check with its English message
  levels/
    level-1.tmj           Tiled map: far, play and collision tile layers and the objects layer
    level-1/far-tiles.png the far layer, with the middle one merged in, cut into the board's 32 px tiles, each once
  tilesets/
    ts-city.png           each tileset picture
    collision.png         the collision tileset: one 16 px tile per tag, typed (solid, oneway…)
  characters/
    willy/<anim>.png      one strip per animation, magenta background, feet on one line
    willy/sheet.json      frames (boxes in the strip), fps, loop, pivots, zones and their palettes, muzzle and hand points
  docs/
    rom-README.md, art-spec.md, hardware.md, story.md, journal.md, file-format.md, moves.md
```

- Every picture is converted to board colors (each channel to the nearest multiple of 17; alpha is on or off). Layers and tilesets keep transparency; strips use magenta `#FF00FF`.
- **No whole-level pictures** (task T-20, lesson E-03: an outside AI found 22 MB per 8192 px level picture, 70 MB unpacked for two levels; the PNGs are written without compression): the play and collision layers are the maps' tile layers over their tilesets, and the far layer is cut into its unique 32 px tiles (`far-tiles.png`), each placed on the map cell of its bottom-left with a 0.5 parallax. Buenos Aires (8192 × 672) packs into about 0.7 MB unpacked, 54 KB zipped.
- The `.tmj` files point at `../tilesets/*.png` and `<level>/far-tiles.png`, so the pack opens in Tiled as it is. Willy Maker's Tiled import reads them back with the same collision and objects. Objects are points, except `camera_lock` and `boss`, which are rectangles, and `platform`, a rectangle as wide as the platform and 8 px tall.
- The docs are the repository's `docs/rom/*.md` plus Willy Maker's `file-format.md` (this file, so `project.json` can be read without the repository) and `moves.md`, bundled with the website and loaded when the pack is made.
- **Deterministic**: the same project gives the same bytes. Entries have a fixed date (2026-01-01 00:00) and a fixed order (`PROMPT.md`, then the rest sorted by name), and PNGs are written without a canvas. Compression uses the browser's own deflate, so two browsers may still differ.
- A picture the browser no longer has (cleared site data) is left out, and `PROMPT.md` names it.

### The generated prompt (`PROMPT.md`)

Filled in from the project and the review, in English, with these sections:

0. **Before you start** (task T-19, lesson E-02): its limits first: a browser is not enough (a shell, the go-link repository, the m68k-elf tools, z80asm, Node and the core), `rom/tools/build.mjs` builds only the prototype, the shortcut (Create ROM in the Export tab, or `node rom/tools/willy-rom.mjs` on the project file) and that neither the pack nor a project file is a ROM.
1. **The brief**: build an arcade ROM for go-link with the tools in `rom/`; the target board (CPS-1, 384 × 224 at 60 Hz, 68000), the set layout (`slammast` 4 × 3 or `captcomm` 4 × 2) and the mame2003-plus core; every byte original; which docs to follow (`docs/` in the pack).
2. **The game**: title and author, the genre (its name and description; a genre with no engine yet says so and points to [genres.md](genres.md)), players, the levels in play order (id, size, camera, sections, map file), the characters (role, height, animations), the buttons and what each does (with 2 buttons, special is buttons 1 + 2), Start/Coin, the DIP switches and the menus.
3. **Rules the engine keeps**: a table of the numbers in `engine/rules.ts` with the game's Rules card applied: body, gravity, jump, fall, ladders, how crates are climbed, run tap, drop-through, camera, weapons, enemies (hits, chase, shoot, touch), crates, lives and blinking, score, the exit, ports past the players, opposite directions.
4. **What is already decided** (task T-10 of [experiment 1's verdict](../experiments/verdict.md)): a table answering the 26 questions (P-01 to P-26) case B's builder had to decide alone, with this game's values, each marked as a setting (and where it lives: the Rules card, an object's property, the DIP switches, the menus) or fixed by the engine: the jump's real height, wide levels and column streaming, what the core's log may say (one `WRONG CHECKSUMS` line per file is expected for a set of your own), which crate `hp` wins, what clears a level, the exit's zone, where each object's point is, what hurts, lives and `energy`, enemy patrols and shots, enemy art, the special button, each player's look, menu timings, the credit counter, sound, what the DIP switches change, shared credits, the lab state and symbol map, the device's own sets, the format doc, which play layer copy wins, sections, the 4-player HUD, tile counts with the empty tile, and the optional room test.
5. **Board limits**: palettes, colors, graphics and program ROM, sprite table, and what the game uses now (the meters).
6. **What is in this pack**: the tree above, the collision tags and the object rules.
7. **Willy Maker's checks at export**: every warning and note, then what passed.
8. **Build it**: the tools (`brew install m68k-elf-binutils m68k-elf-gcc z80asm`, Node 22.18 or newer), `node rom/tools/build.mjs` first to prove the toolchain, then extend it to read the pack, framelab with `-log` in the core, and `node rom/tools/room-test.mjs` in a go-link room.
9. **Task**: produce `<layout>.zip`, keep within the budgets, test it, and report changes and open decisions.

The Export screen previews its first paragraph and has **Copy prompt**.

## Background scenes

A level whose background was made with Insert background and Add scene keeps its pictures in `scenes` (the play layer's art is laid out from them, left to right; the editor does it again when one changes):

```jsonc
"scenes": [
  { "id": "scene-…", "asset": "sha256:…", "name": "01-dock.png", "x": 0,   "dy": 0,  "scale": 1 },
  { "id": "scene-…", "asset": "sha256:…", "name": "05-bridge.png", "x": 1920, "dy": 22, "scale": 1 }
]
```

`asset` is the picture as given (in `assets/`), `x` its left edge in px, `dy` how far it is moved down from standing on the level's bottom (negative: up), `scale` its height as a share of the level's (0.25-4). Each scene is stretched a few pixels so its width is whole 32 px columns.
