# Case C: how to do it again

Experiment 1, case C ([contract](../README.md), [harness](../harness.md)): Willy Maker gets **Create ROM** (stage 2: a prebuilt data-driven engine plus a packer in the browser), then Game Spec v1 is made in the browser as a user would, from **New game** to the downloaded `slammast.zip`.

This guide has two parts, and each one can be copied and pasted:

- **[Part 1, developer](#part-1-developer-get-the-create-rom-build):** get the build that has Create ROM, check the engine, run the site.
- **[Part 2, user](#part-2-user-from-new-game-to-the-download-and-a-room):** every click of the recorded session with its screenshot and its place in the video, then the ROM on a go-link device.

The step-by-step guide made from the same recording is [evidence/session/guide.html](evidence/session/guide.html) (open it from a checkout: it reads the screenshots next to it). The end result to compare with is at the bottom: [the SHA-256 of every file inside the zip](#what-you-should-get).

| Target | Value |
|---|---|
| Base commit | `23806b8` (main, with the experiment harness) |
| Case branch | `exp1/case-c`, results at `7da8ccb` |
| The ROM | `slammast.zip`, 55 854 bytes, 28 files, SHA-256 `b1742aac038263f5f8323bdb64a99ce2c579c98192c699abab2f87c94f45d990` |
| Its symbol map | `slammast.symbols.json` (also downloaded as `symbols.json`), SHA-256 `1d19fccea0423c986bd5e16d3af64b26755a9a36c5844dd53ff492713c45b243` |
| Verified | 2026-10-01 22:42-22:50 (-03), by applying the patches on `23806b8` in a clean worktree and replaying the session: the same zip, byte for byte |

## Time each part took

| Part | In the case (journal, 2026-10-01) | Reproduced from this guide (Intel i9 Mac, warm npm cache) |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Build Create ROM (engine, packer, rules, the Export card, tests) | 18:06-18:36, **30 min**; later fixes (D-016, D-017, D-021, D-022) about 20 min more | apply the patches 0.2 s, `npm ci` 1.5 s, engine check 2.4 s, the ROM test 4.2 s: **under 1 min** |
| 2a. The session, rehearsals | 18:36-18:48, **12 min**, 4 trials (two found real problems, see [When it goes wrong](#when-it-goes-wrong)) | none needed |
| 2b. The session, recorded | **227 s** for 82 steps (each step has 1.5 s of note card before it, so about 100 s are actions) | **192 s** (`session.mjs`), MP4 and guide 21 s |
| 2c. Play on my go-link (level 4) | ran inside the acceptance | `device romtest` **3 s** |
| 3. Acceptance | 19:30-19:48, **18 min**, almost all of it Laya (1.6-2.0 s per decision on a loaded machine) | without Laya **76 s** (levels 3 and 4, script, core compare, bot 5/5); damage and odd-input scripts 1 s each |
| Whole case | 18:06-19:49, **103 min** ([metrics.json](metrics.json)) | about **8 min** of wall time |

## Part 1, developer: get the Create ROM build

### 1.1 Tools (macOS, Homebrew)

```sh
brew install m68k-elf-binutils m68k-elf-gcc z80asm ffmpeg
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 22.23.2      # Node 22.18 or newer: the tools import TypeScript
```

The device CLI is only needed for level 4, the real-core replay and a room: `make device-darwin-universal` builds `dist/device/darwin-universal/go-link.app`, and `go-link.app/Contents/MacOS/go-link-device core download` fetches the core once (it lives in `~/go-link/cores/`).

### 1.2 The code: the branch, or the patches on `23806b8`

Either check out the case's branch:

```sh
cd go-link                           # your clone
git fetch origin exp1/case-c         # when it is published; locally it already exists
git switch exp1/case-c
```

or apply the case's 15 commits on the base commit. [howto/exp1-case-c.mbox](howto/exp1-case-c.mbox) is `git format-patch --binary 23806b8..7da8ccb` without `docs/experiments/case-c/evidence/` (the screenshots and reports stay on the branch); it carries the engine binary, so keep `--binary` patches whole:

```sh
git show exp1/case-c:docs/experiments/case-c/howto/exp1-case-c.mbox > /tmp/exp1-case-c.mbox   # or download the file
git worktree add --detach ../go-link-case-c 23806b8
cd ../go-link-case-c
git am --committer-date-is-author-date /tmp/exp1-case-c.mbox      # 15 commits, no conflicts
git diff --stat exp1/case-c -- . ':(exclude)docs/experiments/case-c/evidence' ':(exclude)docs/experiments/case-c/HOWTO.md' ':(exclude)docs/experiments/case-c/howto'
# prints nothing: the tree is the branch's, the evidence aside
```

What the patches add, commit by commit (each message names its decisions, [decisions.md](decisions.md); file to commit map in [trace.md](trace.md)):

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `c4febdd` | `rom/tools/art.mjs`: the level art optional, the recruits a list (the prototype's 28 files unchanged) |
| `825fed6` | `rom/engine/` (the data-driven engine, `wmdata.h`) and `rom/tools/engine.mjs`, which builds it into `frontend/apps/web/public/willy-maker/engine/` |
| `72b08b2` | `GameRules`: game rules as data, read by play mode and packed for the engine |
| `b0745ad` | the packer (`willy-maker/rom/pack.ts`, `createRom.ts`), `@go-link/cps1` `splitProgram`, the spec level as a test fixture |
| `35573e7` | **Create ROM** in the Export tab, the Rules card, enemy hits and the exit's width in the inspector; en, es, pt |
| `bda1433` | number fields keep what is typed until it is in range (the 164 bug, D-017) |
| `a6de8c3` | the session scripts (`session/session.mjs`, `publish.mjs`), the route player and the first `clear.json` |
| `5167fbb` | the engine source put back to its committed build (D-016) |
| `528e392` | `docs/willy-maker/engine.md` and the docs |
| `4cd6830`, `9985e6e`, `a86add3` | the reach check climbs 48 px, not 64 (D-021) |
| `091cc4c` | the title clears both prompts (the stray "I", D-022); engine rebuilt |
| `b8cbbdf`, `7da8ccb` | the final ROM, its runs, the records and the acceptance |

### 1.3 The engine asset

The engine is C for the 68000, built once and shipped with the site as `frontend/apps/web/public/willy-maker/engine/engine.bin` plus `engine.json` (sizes, SHA-256, symbol map). It is committed, so you only check it; rebuild only after changing `rom/engine/` or the art:

```sh
node rom/tools/engine.mjs --check    # must print: engine: the committed engine matches this build
node rom/tools/engine.mjs            # only after a change: rewrites public/willy-maker/engine/
```

### 1.4 Tests

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
CI=true WM_ROM_OUT=/tmp/wm npx vitest run apps/web/src/willy-maker/rom/rom.test.tsx   # 5 passed
npm run typecheck && CI=true npx vitest run && npm run build                             # 622 passed, 2 skipped
```

`WM_ROM_OUT` keeps the spec fixture's ROM (built by code, not by clicks): its `slammast.zip` is `5e3800db2a9aadc2e1b0127f54d96cf93f24d4c970f7aeb85cf8de11e90485d4`. It is a different level layout from the session's (the fixture places things by code), so its hash is not the session's.

### 1.5 Run the site

```sh
cd frontend
npm run dev -w apps/web -- --port 5401 --strictPort      # leave it running
```

Open <http://localhost:5401/tools/willy-maker>. Use a free port of your own; the scripts default to 5302 and take `WM_URL`. The signaling server refuses unknown origins, which only matters for linking a device (Part 2, step 81 and after): use the site's normal port for that.

### 1.6 Replay the session by script (optional, gives the same zip)

```sh
# from the repository root, with the site of 1.5 running
WM_URL=http://localhost:5401 \
PLAYWRIGHT=$PWD/e2e/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs \
  node docs/experiments/case-c/session/session.mjs /tmp/session        # ends with: 82 steps, 0 errors
FFMPEG=$(command -v ffmpeg) \
  node docs/experiments/case-c/session/publish.mjs /tmp/session --mp4 /tmp/session/session.mp4   # 82 chapters
shasum -a 256 /tmp/session/slammast.zip       # b1742aac038263f5f8323bdb64a99ce2c579c98192c699abab2f87c94f45d990
```

`e2e/node_modules` must exist (`cd e2e && npm ci && npx playwright install chromium`); a worktree has none, so point `PLAYWRIGHT` at another checkout's copy.

## Part 2, user: from New game to the download and a room

Everything here is clicks in the site of 1.5, in the order the recording made them. The video is `session.mp4` (1920 × 1080, 227 s, one chapter per step, titled `NN · what`), kept outside git in the experiment's shared folder `exp1/case-c/`; 1.6 makes it again. The **Video** column is the chapter's start, so you can jump to it. Screenshots are taken 1.5 s before each action, with the control outlined and a note card saying what and why. Full size originals: `exp1/case-c/session-final/shots/`.

### The values, in one place

| Where | Value |
|---|---|
| New game | board CPS-1, layout **4 players · 3 buttons** (slammast), template **Empty** |
| Name and players | title `Willy Gorklingo`, author `go-link · experiment 1, case C`, **2 players** |
| First level | name `Dead Air`, **4 screens** (1536 px), height **448 px** |
| View | **Zoom out** 4 times (about 82 %), then click the middle of the **Level map** strip |
| Far background, Tiles, Fill | tile 1 over rows 0-4, tile 3 over rows 5-9, tile 5 over rows 10-13, columns 0-47 (32 px cells) |
| Collision, Terrain | Pencil + **Crate** at cells (10,24), (12,24), (12,22); Fill + **Platform** (16,22)-(22,22); **Ladder** (30,16)-(30,25); **Solid** (31,16)-(63,16) (16 px cells: cell × 16 = world px) |
| Enemies | Pencil + **Trooper** at world (640,416), (800,256), (1360,416) |
| Civilians | **Woman** at (320,352), **Child** at (960,256) |
| Helpers | **Exit** at (1440,416), inspector **Width 64** |
| Game tab, Rules | hits **3**, points per enemy **100**, per rescue **500**, touching hurts **Yes**, chase **No**, shoot **No**, the exit needs every enemy down **Yes**, after a hit **Blink in place**, blinking **60 frames** (focus the slider, 6 × Left arrow), lives **3** |
| Menus | title `WILLY GORKLINGO`, subtitle `THE LAG PROTOCOL`, prompt `PUSH START` (default), HUD › Level clear `SECTION CLEAR` |
| Export | **Create ROM**, wait for the power-on result, **Download ROM**, **Symbol map** |

The canvas tells its view in its `data-view` attribute (`x,y,zoom`), which is how the script turns world pixels into page pixels: page = canvas box + (world − view) × zoom. A click by hand on another cell changes the level and so the hash: compare with each screenshot.

| 81 | 3:38 | **Play on my go-link**<br>It sends the ROM to the linked go-link; this recording has no device linked, so it says how to link one. | `role=button[name="Play on my go-link"]` | <a href="evidence/session/shots/81.jpg"><img src="evidence/session/shots/81.jpg" width="240" alt="Step 81: Play on my go-link"></a> |
| 82 | 3:42 | **Done: the level is built, the ROM created, powered on and downloaded**<br>Next: the harness checks this exact zip (levels 3 and 4, the clear script, the real core). | `.wm-rom-card` | <a href="evidence/session/shots/82.jpg"><img src="evidence/session/shots/82.jpg" width="240" alt="Step 82: Done: the level is built, the ROM created, powered on and downloaded"></a> |

### After the download: the ROM on a go-link device

**Play on my go-link** (step 81) powers the created set on with the linked device's real core: validation level 4, the device's room core in a worker, without touching the ROM folder (D-011). The recording had no device linked, so the card says how to link one. With a device linked (**My device**, its 9-digit code) the same button runs the ten device steps. The same check from the device's CLI:

```sh
go-link.app/Contents/MacOS/go-link-device romtest ~/Downloads/slammast.zip
#   ok zip, set, identity ("not a go-link set: it shows as the core's original game"), core.loaded (384x224 at 60.00 Hz),
#   ok core.files (28 files differ from the original set: the core warns and runs them), video.picture, video.alive,
#   ok audio (silent), input.reacts (Coin at frame 300), time.realtime
# PASSED: the set powers on in this core.
```

**A room.** Case C did not open a room with this ROM: no device was linked to the recording, and Willy Maker's "Play on my go-link" stops at level 4 (checklist item 2, "partly"; [engine.md](../../willy-maker/engine.md#what-the-rom-leaves-out-for-now)). The device's ROM check does accept the set, though, under the original game's name (run on a separate folder at 22:49, never the user's ROM folder):

```sh
mkdir /tmp/wm-roms && cp ~/Downloads/slammast.zip /tmp/wm-roms/
go-link-device roms check --dir /tmp/wm-roms
# slammast  ok  Saturday Night Slam Masters (World 930713)
```

So the room path, **not run in case C**, is the device's normal one:

1. **My device › ROMs**: drop `slammast.zip` on "Drop ROM sets or pictures here, or click to choose". The device never overwrites: if the ROM folder already has a `slammast.zip` (the real game), the import is refused; move that one out first and put it back afterwards.
2. **Rooms › New game › Choose a game**: the set appears as *Saturday Night Slam Masters (World 930713)*, since a ROM is named by the core's game list.
3. Create the room, then **Invite** a second player (link or code plus a one-person PIN); P1 Willy and P2 the recruit play with B1 jump, B2 fire, Coin and Start.

## Acceptance (to compare with the case's results)

```sh
DEV=dist/device/darwin-universal/go-link.app/Contents/MacOS/go-link-device
ZIP=/tmp/session/slammast.zip       # or docs/experiments/case-c/build/slammast.zip
node rom/tools/lab/acceptance.mjs $ZIP --script docs/experiments/case-c/runs/clear.json \
  --out /tmp/case-c-acceptance --bot-games 5 --skip laya --device $DEV        # about 76 s
node rom/tools/lab/run.mjs $ZIP --out /tmp/damage --script docs/experiments/case-c/runs/damage.json
node rom/tools/lab/run.mjs $ZIP --out /tmp/odd    --script docs/experiments/case-c/runs/odd-inputs.json
```

Expected (and what the reproduction got): `level3`, `level4`, `scripted`, `sameAsCore` all `true`, `bot` "5/5 cleared"; the scripted run clears at frame **1883** with 18 of 18 expectations; the damage script ends in GAME OVER at frame **1273**; the odd-inputs script is still playing at frame **900**. With Laya (`--laya-games 3`, drop `--skip laya`) the case got 0 of 3 clears (it presses fire), at 1.6-2.0 s per decision: plan 15 minutes to over an hour. A clear script for a changed level: [harness.md](../harness.md) and `runs/route-player.mjs` + `runs/make-clear.mjs`.

## When it goes wrong

Each of these happened in the case ([journal.md](journal.md)) or in the reproduction of this guide.

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| No `rom/tools/lab/`, no `lab_state.h`, no `docs/experiments/` | The worktree was at `76cd798`, before the harness (journal 18:06) | Start from `23806b8` or later (D-001) |
| `engine.mjs --check` fails although you changed nothing | The engine's source was edited after its committed build (journal 19:00) | Put the source back or rebuild with `node rom/tools/engine.mjs` and redo every ROM made since; the committed binary is what Create ROM uses (D-016) |
| Your zip is `4b315b28…`, not `b1742aac…` | The engine before `091cc4c`: the title leaves a stray "I" from INSERT COIN under PUSH START (journal 19:16) | Use the branch's tip or all 15 patches (D-022) |
| The exit's width becomes **164** after typing 64 | Before `bda1433`, number fields clamped every keystroke: "6" became the minimum 16, then "4" was appended (session trial 2) | Use the fixed build; on an old one, check the field after typing and press Tab (D-017) |
| A script cannot find the sky tile buttons | They show only a picture; their name ("Tile 1") is only the accessible name (session trial 1) | Look them up by role, `getByRole("button", { name: "Tile 1" })`; by hand, they are the 1st, 3rd and 5th tiles of the night sky (screenshots 18, 20, 22) |
| The woman on the ledge cannot be rescued from the dock | The jump peaks at 61.9 px, so a ledge 64 px above the dock is out of reach (journal 18:25) | Climb the 64 px crate stack and jump across from it, as in steps 28-33 (D-015); Willy Maker's **Reach** now checks 48 px (D-021) |
| The route bot clears but rescues only the child | It never takes the jump from the stack to the ledge (journal 18:26) | Expected; `runs/route-player.mjs` follows the spec's route and rescues both |
| `npm run build` fails on a test file | A test literal not typed as `PowerOnStep` (journal 18:35) | Fixed in `35573e7`; run `npm run build` as well as the tests |
| An ExportView test expects Create ROM to be disabled | The old test of stage 1 (journal 18:35) | Replaced by `CreateRomCard.test.tsx` in `35573e7` |
| The AI pack round-trip test times out at 30 s | The machine was at load 68 (other cases' Laya players) | Run it again when the load drops; it passed in the full run (622 tests) |
| Laya takes hours | It runs on the CPU, 0.3-4 s per decision with the load | `--skip laya`, or run its games in parallel with `--seed` as the case did |
| The console shows the signaling server refusing the origin | Port 5302 (or 5401-5409) is not an allowed origin | Harmless while building; link a device from the site's normal origin |
| `session.mjs` cannot import Playwright | A worktree has no `e2e/node_modules` (reproduction) | `PLAYWRIGHT=/path/to/a/checkout/e2e/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs` |
| `session.mjs` cannot reach the site | It defaults to `http://localhost:5302` | `WM_URL=http://localhost:5401` (the port you used in 1.5) |
| `publish.mjs` cannot find ffmpeg | It defaults to `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg` (Intel Homebrew) | `FFMPEG=$(command -v ffmpeg)` (Apple silicon: `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg`) |
| `romtest` fails to start | No core yet | `go-link-device core download` |
| Another zip hash after a session by hand | A click landed on another cell, or a typed value differs | Compare your screen with each screenshot; or run 1.6, which gives the exact zip |

Where each file sits (`frontend/packages/cps1/src/sets.ts`): `mbe_23e.rom` is the 68000 program at 0x000000 (the prebuilt engine), `mbe_21a.rom` the program space at 0x100000 (the game as `wm_data`), `mbe_24b/28b/25b/29b.rom` (0x080000-0x0fffff) and `mbe_20a.rom` (0x180000) the unused program space; the graphics are three banks of four, `mb_gfx01-04.rom`, `mb_05-08.bin` and `mb_10-13.bin` (the last bank unused); `mb_qa.rom` is the Z80 sound program and `mb_q1-8.bin` the silent samples. That is why some hashes repeat: every unused 512 KB file has the same fill (`043e238a…`), the four unused 128 KB program files share `b5a41c37…`, and the eight samples share `07854d2f…`.

If only some files differ, they say where to look: `mbe_21a.rom` alone means a different project (a click, a typed value, a rule); `mbe_23e.rom` a different engine (see D-016 and D-022 above); `mb_gfx*`/`mb_05-08` the tiles drawn (for example another sky tile on the far layer) or the engine's sprites; `mb_qa.rom` the packer's Z80 program or its encryption.

## Evidence of the recorded session

- [evidence/session/guide.html](evidence/session/guide.html): the 82 steps with time, what, why, selector and screenshot.
- [evidence/session/timeline.json](evidence/session/timeline.json): the same as data; `t` is seconds from the start of the browser's video.
- [evidence/README.md](evidence/README.md): the acceptance reports and the simulator | core | difference frames.
- [checklist.md](checklist.md): the 30 items of Game Spec v1 with their evidence and the gaps (the Trooper drawn as the Lag android, the jump's 61.9 px, the room).
